This repository is a part of a bachelor project completed in the University of luxembourg.

The project is focused on exploration of continuous travel in virtual reality given constraints of space imposed on the user. The proposed solutions is simulation of non-Euclidean means of transport via portals. The solution is demonstrated in the developed WebGL engine that supports said simulation. The following are the components of this package:
* [Source code](src) for the developed engine.
* [Instruction of use](README.md) to run the project.
* [SnT report](bics_bsp_s1_2022_leonint_amarantos_overleaf_bsp_st_report.pdf) produced with the project, that details the design, production and motivation behind the project.


# Instructions of use
To run the program launch server.py script.
```
python server.py
```

It will open the application in a default browser.

On the landing page the user is to press run demo button.

On the next page the controlls are "wasd" for walking and mouse/trackpad for panning around.
